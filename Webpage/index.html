    <h1> Hey! Welcome to my Genius Hour Project!</h1>
    <p> In this project (which can be found here <a> https://github.com/Canjap/NLP-OpenCV-Food-Labels </a>), I 
        created this website which uses the users camera to take pictures of food packages and store its 
    name and nutrition facts. Hope you like it! </p>
