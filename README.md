# NLP-OpenCV-Food-Labels -- ~ 245 Lines (May 2023)
 
Hi, this is my Genius Hour project. Ever wanted to store and keep track of nutrition labels using CSVs (spreadheets)? Probably not, but say you were a food pantry: wouldn't it be nice to just scan anything you branded food and keep track of it's nutrition facts? That's my goal, and I'll come back to this project to fix the bugs, issues, and maybe even rewrite it in another programming language.
